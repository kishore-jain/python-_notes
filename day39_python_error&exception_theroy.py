# Difference b/w Error & Exception : { should be answered in interviews }

# er - to be found in compile time
# ex - to be found only in runtime error

# er - error cannot be identified by user
# ex - exception can be identified by user

# er - error cannot be predicted in advance
# ex - exception can be predicted

# er - error cannot be controlled
# ex - exception can be controlled

# er - error cann't be handled
# ex - exception can be handled

# er - error cann't be recovered
# ex - exception can be recovered

# er - error cannot be avoided
# ex - exception can be avoided in advance


# Exception handler components :

# Java                                          python
# ----                                          ------

# exception class                               exception class
# error class (throw)

 # Exception handler components
 
# ------------------------------

# try block
# catch block
# except block
# finally block

# Try block - checking the critical statements in a program to find error

# catch block -  it will be caught the found error from try block

# except block - checking for alternate code against to found error
