#benifits of threading
#---------------------

#1.resource sharing
#2.improved communication in os
#3.RAM boosting
#4.enhanced concurrency
#5.resourse efficiency
#6.parellel processing
#7.increased throughput
#8.automation support (if we install a app in a app store it will come to the home screen automatically)
#9.effective CPU utilization

#what is thread ?

#thread is a light weight process(LWP)
#thread is a basic unit of excecution

#thread is a fundamental unit of CPU utilization
#thread is a single sequence flow of control with in a program
#thread is a subject focus/enhanced theme/excecution path
#thread is a smallest sequence of instructions which can be managged independently by a scheduler (for later excecutoion)
>>> #process-when the program enters into running state
>>> #when a program is created there will be a thread that available thread is said to be the main tread
>>> 
>>> 
>>> #multi threading
>>> #ability of a operating system(os)/machine to excecute more than one thread concurrently at a time
>>> 
>>> #multi threading common goals :
>>> #concurrent execution
>>> #high performance
>>> #effective utilization (CPU/GPU)
>>> #browser automation
