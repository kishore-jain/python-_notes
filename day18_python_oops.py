# oops
# ----

# oops--> object oriented programming structure/system

# oops ==> combines / binding data and multiple functions in a single unit so that the following things will be achieved

# benefits
# --------
# code reusability
# reliability of code
# durability of code

# adaptability of code
# maintainability of code

# major components of oops
# ------------------------
# classes / objects /data abstraction/data encapsulation
# inheritance / polymorphism /self keyword /_init_constructor

# SPECIAL NOTES:

# java does not support multiple inheritance directly(but python does)

# python does not support function / method overloading(but java does)

>>> # class is a container of methods
>>> # class usually creates local name spaces for methods

>>> # class is a collection of properties and attribute values
>>> # # class is a collection of properties and attribute values
>>> # class is a collection of different states and behaviors
>>> # class is a prototype for creating objects
>>> # class is a blurprint for creating objects
>>> # calss is a collection of objects
>>> # calss is a collection of methods
>>> # calss is a collection of code templates
>>> 
>>> # class is a collection of data ( variables) and members(function)

>>> # SLA --> domain -->python -->student-->srikanth
>>> # cls - function - member - variable - data
