# Data abstraction
# ---------------

# data abstraction =(data hiding process)
# showing only the required functionalities by hiding the complexity for internal program implementation

# abstraction = describes hidden working culture/workflow of method/function

# ex:- atm machine cash withdraw / coffee vending /face recognition /biometric / fax car senser /  drone / ir remote / fridge threshold / auto brighness

# data encapsulation
# ------------------

# encapsulation = data binding process / data bunding process

# encapsulation = data hiding + dynamic binding inside a singe unit

# this combines the data of multiple method inside a singe unit

# ex:- gpay - chrome -banking services - upi- payment gateway -spotify-notes

# polymorphism
# ------------

# POLY = many /morphism = forms
# polymorphism =many forms

# a function with same name performs different behaviors

# java students
# -------------
# static polymorphism
# dynamic polymorphism

# static polymorphism
# --------------------
# static polymorphism is also called as method overloading
# static poly is also called as EARLY BINDING

# many method with different behaviors are having same name

# dynamic polymorphism
# --------------------

# this is also called as method overriding
# if a child class is having a method with sameand parameters exactly as the parent class then it is called dynamic poly

# note : if you want to access both parent class together then use SUPER key word

# variable used in OOPS
# ---------------------

# class variable
# local variable
# global variable
# instance varible


# class variable
# --------------

>>> # if a var is declared inside the but outside of all method then it is common to all class method
>>> 
>>> # class var enforces commen usage to all cls methods
>>> 
>>> 
>>> # var - ac/tv
>>> # class - house hall
>>> # method - match viewers /family members
>>> 
>>> 
>>> # var - water filter
>>> # class - 3rd floor
>>> # method - 3rd floor auditorium / hr cabin /reception cabin / counselors room /tech room
>>> 
>>> 
>>> 
>>> # local variable
>>> # --------------
>>> 
>>> # if a variable is declared inside  a specific method them it should be used only by that method
>>> 
>>> # ex:-finger print
>>> 
>>> 
>>> # global variable
>>> # ---------------
