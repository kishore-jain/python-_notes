# inheritance
# -----------

# sub:-

# if a child class is inheriting the proparties of a base(parent) class
# types of inhertance
# -------------------

# singe inhertance
# multiple inhertance
# multilevel inhertance
# hierarchical inhertance
# those mixed inhertance called hybrid inherrance

# single inhertance
# -----------------
# if a single child is inheriting properties of a single parent
# parent-->child-->properties-->inheritance
# ex:- standalone applications

>>> # single application single purpose  ku use pannarathakku single inheritance ex calculator and music player
>>> 
>>> # multiple inheritance
>>> # --------------------
>>> # if a single child is inheritiing properties from multiple independent base classes
>>> 
>>> # ex=> RK==>LIC(p1)-->SLA(P2)-->HDFEDSL(P3)---->SUMMINGPOOL(P4)
>>> 
>>> # REAL TIME EX==> GPAY(CHILD)==>TRAIN(UPI)--->EC(UPI)---->PIZZA(UPI)--->REDBUS(UPI) THIS CALLED    MULTIPLE inheritence.
>>> 
>>> # multilevel inheritance
>>> # ----------------------
>>> # multilevel inheritance ex: phone--> sim-1,sim-2 slots
>>> # if a single child is inheriting properties of another child from previous layer
>>> 
>>> # REAL TIME EX==>Arumugam(1st,o+,actor,singer,script,dram)--->Abraham(2nd,o+,drawing,TNEB)-------->Rk(3rd,o+,pro singer,tm)----->Alvina(4th,o+,actor,singer,script)
>>> 
>>> # Real time EX:-Gpay<---zomato<--- hotal /food <---payment <---- Gmap
>>> 
>>> # Hierarchical inheritance
>>> # ------------------------
>>> # is a single parent is haviing multiple childer,then each child is having limited / restricted    access
>>> # EX:-Abraham(32K)==>raja(10k,om)-->nimer(7k,TR)--->RK(2K,TM)
>>>
